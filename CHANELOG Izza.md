You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

In the future, the CHANGELOG will be used to document changes in your
designs, so we can gauge your progress. Please keep it updated at each stage
of development.
